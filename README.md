PlateMate Project

About us

PlateMate is a project created by Rachel, Jennie, Eddie and Josh  and designed to facilitate the passion of cooking while listening to music. Listening to music while eating is an excellent way of feeling exhilarated and being in the mode. Platemate is a service that allows you to enjoy a music playlist of your choosing that pairs with the image file of food you inputted. Platemate will auto-detect and pair appropriate music that fits accordingly to the image file a user has sent while cooking delicious dishes. Our motivation to develop this application was our love of food and music. The combination of music and cooking will create a good atmosphere at home and a pleasant feeling inside. 
Technologies used in this development included the following:
HTML – our main structure and semantics of our site.
CSS – the styling and rules our html
Javascript – to give our website dynamism and an interactive ability we went with Javascript
Ajax – We wanted the ability to update our website without reloading the full page. Ajax gave us that ability.
JQuery – to give us shortcuts while coding Javascript we utilized JQuery for faster coding progression
Firebase – we needed a system to store our login and sign up data. We chose firebase for authentication purposes.
Clarifai.com – we needed a machine learning system to help analyze image files and get us data to we could then pair it with music.
To start our design process, we began defining the concept of our project verbally and scaled it back so could accomplish the goal. We pseudo-coded some parts of our ideas and began soft coding parts of the core system. After much deliberation we decided to strongly progress with the core technologies we discovered and began to implement them in the website.
