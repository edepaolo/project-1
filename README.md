PlateMate Project

About us

PlateMate is a project Rachel, Jennie, Eddie and Josh designed to facilitate the service of cooking a recipe while listening to music. Listening to music while eating is an excellent way of feeling exhilarated and being in the mode. Platemate is a service that allows you to enjoy a music playlist of your choosing that pairs with the image file of food you input. Platemate will auto-detect and pair appropriate music that fits accordingly to the image file the user has inputted while cooking. This combination of music, cooking, and food image will create a good atmosphere at home and nirvana in the brain. 
Enjoy your delicious dish you cooked while pairing it with an awesome sound track you equated with an image clone of your food.
